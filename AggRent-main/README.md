# AggRent
An innovative tool that facilitates renting, buying and selling of used and new agriculture machinery. It solves the problem of farmers with old and outdated equipment not being able to acquire modern machinery. It also solves the problem of farmers having machinery sitting around during off season. Our website also has a blog that connects farmers.

Keeping the theme in mind, we brainstormed possible problems and their solutions. We noticed that our problem did not have enough viable solutions. This inspired us to work on our problem

Our website will charge a fee depending on the % cost of machinery and the time period of the rent. It will also generate additional revenue through product advertisements and premium memberships.

Designing the website by integrating the backend and frontend was a major challenge as it was all new to us. Another challenge we faced was the CSS portion as it was very difficult to align the elements and put them where we needed them. The last challenge we faced was integrating Roboflow into our project. We overcame these difficulties by researching and working with each other, assigning each team member to work on a different part of the problem. When we ran into a roadblock, we switched roles to get a refresher.
